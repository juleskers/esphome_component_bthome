Beethowen Receiver
==================

.. _bthome_common_format: :doc:`./bthome_common_format.rst`

**Beethowen** is an energy efficient method to transfer data over 
`ESP-NOW <https://www.espressif.com/en/solutions/low-power-solutions/esp-now>`_ Wireless 
Communication Protocol by Espressif Systems between two devices.
*The name came from a playful 2 am brainstorming from "BTHome" + "Over" + "Esp-NoW".*

This component implements local receiver and decoding hub that can be used both on ESP8266 and ESP32 devices.

**ESP-NOW**
  is a wireless communication protocol defined by Espressif, which enables the direct, 
  quick and low-power control of smart devices, without the need of a router. ESP-NOW can work 
  with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE, and supports the ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-S and ESP32-C series of SoCs. 
  It’s widely used in smart-home appliances, remote controlling, sensors, etc.

**BTHome**
  is an energy efficient but flexible format for devices to broadcast their sensor data and button presses 
  originally developed for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices. Devices can run over a year on a single battery.
  It allows data encryption and is supported by popular home automation platforms, 
  like `Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io>`__, out of the box.

Notes:

- Supports V1 and V2 **unencryted** formats as for now.

- Home Assistant support is planned, yet not implemented yet. Passive BLE Monitor integration 
  can take RAW HCI packets, that provide an easy way to channel in this payload.

.. _beethowen hub component:

Component/Hub
-------------

The ``beethowen_receiver`` component creates a global hub so that you can track beethowen
devices using your ESP node over the BTHome V2 protocol.

The beethowen component is an internal model that acts as a central reception 
and dispatcher hub to which beethowen virtual devices and sensors are connected to.

As for now the ``wifi`` component with an access point setting should be included.

.. _config-beethowen:

Configuration variables:
************************

  (at log.level=DEBUG) for any device.

Automations
***********

on_packet
~~~~~~~~~
This automation will be triggered when a transmission is successfully received.
In Lambdas you can get the *address* of the sender device and the list of *measurements* received.

.. code-block:: yaml

  beethowen_receiver:
    on_packet: # on_packet(address, measurements)
      - light.turn_on:
          id: my_led
          flash_length: 50ms

on_event
~~~~~~~~
This automation will be triggered when a transmission with event type is successfully received.
In Lambdas you can get the *address* of the sender device and the *event* received.

Named events are available as well for each subevent type such as **on_button_click** or **on_dimmer_rotate_left**.
Event types are described in `bthome common format <bthome_common_format.rst>`__.

.. code-block:: yaml

  beethowen_receiver:
    on_event: # on_event(address, event)
      - lambda: |-
          ESP_LOGI("app", "event received {device_type} %d {event_type} %d {value} %d", x.device_type, x.event_type, x.value);
    devices:
      - mac_address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
        on_event: # on_event(address, event)
          - lambda: |-
              ESP_LOGI("app", "event received {device_type} %d {event_type} %d {value} %d", x.device_type, x.event_type, x.value);
        on_button_click: # on_event(address, event)
          - lambda: |-
              ESP_LOGI("app", "on_button_click");
        on_button_long_click: # on_event(address, event)
          - lambda: |-
              ESP_LOGI("app", "on_button_long_click");

Authorization with a premature security concept:
************************************************

As ESP-NOW is a a highly insecure channel it is not recommended to use it for purposes above sensing and broacasting.
Opposed to the BLE broadcast mechanism I have implemented a handshake in which remote client send directed data to preidentified servers.

An optional handshake mechanism is easing this process where each node owns a local passkey that is included in the ransmission and checked on the recepient side.
Proposed scenario is as follows:

- `beethowen_transmitter` client is looking for a server with find_server message using its local passkey of 0x1234

- `beethowen_receiver` server receives the command, validates the passkey against the expected passkey and answers only if it matches the passkey specified for the selected mac_address client 

- `beethowen_receiver` server answers with a server found response with its local passkey of 0x4567

- `beethowen_transmitter` client receives the command, validates the passkey against the expected passkey and answers only if it matches the passkey specified.
  As it matches it accepts the server as the valid recepient for the sensing data.

- `beethowen_transmitter` client sends sensor data using its local passkey of 0x1234

- `beethowen_receiver` server receives the sensor data, validates the passkey against the expected passkey and accepts only if it matches the passkey specified for the selected mac_address client.
  As it matches it accepts the sensor data as the valid recepient for the sensing data.

.. _bthome-sensor:

Sensor and Binary Sensor as *virtual device*
--------------------------------------------

The ``beethowen sensor`` allows you use a sensor to display received measurement from a remote 
Beethowen device.
First, you need to define a :ref:`beethowen hub component`.

The beethowen sensor component (or "device") is an internal model that acts as a central reception 
and dispatcher hub for a specific remote device identified by a ``mac_address`` to which beethowen 
sensors are connected to.

To initialize a sensor, first supply ``mac_address`` to identify the remote Beethowen device.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    beethowen_receiver:

    # Individual sensors
    sensor:
      - platform: beethowen_receiver
        mac_address: "11:22:33:44:55:55"
        sensors:
          - measurement_type: temperature
            name: Temperature
          - measurement_type: 0x02
            name: Temperature_Second
            accuracy_decimals: 2
            unit_of_measurement: °C


.. _config-beethowen-sensor:

Configuration variables:
************************

- **mac_address** (**Required**, mac-address): The address of the sensor.

- **sensors** (*Required*): List of remote sensors connected to this virtual device.
  
  - **name** (*Optional*): The name for the sensor. At least one of **id** and **name** must be specified.

  - **measurement_type** (*Required*, int **or** string): Measurement type as defined in 
    `BTHome format specification <https://bthome.io/format>`__ either as a string or a numeric value. 
    If selected by name (string) the accuracy and unit of measurement are automatically defaulted to 
    the correct values.
    
    Measurement type `further details <bthome_common_format.rst>`__ to be taken into account.
